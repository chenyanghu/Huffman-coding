# Huffman-coding

## 1. Huffman Coding

   The first step in this project is to develop a program that generates Huffman codes. This project evaluate which of the following priority queue structures gives best performance: Binary Heap, 4-way cache optimized heap and Pairing Heap.
    
## 2. Encoder

   The encoder reads an input file that is to be compressed and generates two output files â€“ the compressed version of the input file and the code table.
